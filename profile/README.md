## Geospatial tools for Dart

✨ New (2023-10): See also the article [Geospatial tools for Dart - version 1.0 published](https://medium.com/@navibyte/geospatial-tools-for-dart-version-1-0-published-0f9673e510b3) at Medium.

🧭 The [geospatial](https://github.com/navibyte/geospatial) code repository with
geospatial data structures, tools and utilities for [Dart](https://dart.dev/)
and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) - coordinates,
geometries, feature objects, metadata, spherical geodesy, projections, tiling
schemes, vector data models and formats, and geospatial Web APIs.

📦 The code package published at
[pub.dev](https://pub.dev/publishers/navibyte.com/packages):

Code           | Package | Description 
-------------- | --------| -----------
:globe_with_meridians: [geobase](https://github.com/navibyte/geospatial/tree/main/dart/geobase) | [![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/geobase.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/geobase) | Geospatial data structures (coordinates, geometries, features, metadata), spherical geodesy, projections and tiling schemes. Vector data format support for [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/), [WKT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry) and [WKB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry#Well-known_binary).
:earth_americas: [geodata](https://github.com/navibyte/geospatial/tree/main/dart/geodata) | [![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/geodata.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/geodata) | Geospatial feature service Web APIs with support for [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) and [OGC API Features](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/features/) clients.

🧩 See [open issues](https://github.com/navibyte/geospatial/issues) for planned features, requests for change, and observed bugs. 

## Geospatial demos for Dart

✨ See also the
[Geospatial demos for Dart](https://github.com/navibyte/geospatial_demos) code
repository for demo and sample apps demonstrating the usage of
[geobase](https://pub.dev/packages/geobase) and
[geodata](https://pub.dev/packages/geodata) along with other topics.

Code          | Description 
------------- | -----------
[earthquake_map](https://github.com/navibyte/geospatial_demos/tree/main/earthquake_map) | Shows earthquakes fetched from the [USGS web service](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/) on a basic map view. The demo uses both [geobase](https://pub.dev/packages/geobase) and [geodata](https://pub.dev/packages/geodata) packages for geospatial data accesss. Discusses also state management based on [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/). The map UI is based on the [Google Maps Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutter) plugin.

📅 The first version of this repository was published in August 2022, updated
October 2023.

## Code and solutions 🗺️

🎯 **Coding with [Dart](https://dart.dev/)** - 
*a client-optimized language for fast apps on any platform* - and actually it's
very powerful for building server-side apps too. Dart code packages 📦 by
Navibyte are published at
[pub.dev](https://pub.dev/publishers/navibyte.com/packages).

💙 **[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) mobile apps** (and even more). This toolkit
allows us to design, build and deploy
*beautiful mobile, web, desktop, and embedded apps from a single codebase*,
based on the Dart language. See also the
[Flutter roadmap](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Roadmap).

🌐 **Geospatial solutions** - you need to understand about geographic and
projected coordinates, projections, tiling schemes, geometry models, features,
feature collections, data formats, geospatial APIs and even maps, visualization
and cartography. It helps when this all is packaged on powerful code libraries -
of course based on Dart and Flutter... 

✍️ **API design** - you need both technology and understanding business use
cases. And it's about integration on multiple different levels to ensure
compatibility. 

📝 **Advancing Open Source** - by building feature rich, reliable and efficient
code packages. You might also want to 🔭 explore 
[Geospatial tools for Dart](https://github.com/navibyte/geospatial) - all code
free and Open Source. Read more from the
